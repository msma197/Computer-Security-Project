# Computer-Security-Project 

This is a Project for Computer Security class. In this Project, we worked on programs related to deepfake.

In this Project, we are planning on comparing two pictures, one of the given pictures is fake where other one is origanal picture. 

The objective of this project is to learn how deepfake works, and how to avoid getting caught in these situations. This project will assist anyone to compare two images and see the difference between them.

**Tutorial on How to Run this program on your machine.**

1. Download PyCharm

     ```
      a) Install matplotlib          (pip install matplotlib)
      b) Install scipy               (pip install scipy)
      c) Install mtcnn               (pip install mtcnn)
      d) Install tensorflow	        (pip install tensorflow)
      e) Install keras_applications  (pip install keras_applications)
     ```

3. Run this project: Python FaceSimilarity.py car.jpeg pic.jpeg 

``` In this command "car.jpeg" is the first picture and "pic.jpeg" is the second picture which we are comparing. In order to test your pictures you can simply add your pictures in the same directory and replace "car.jpeg" and "pic.jpeg" with your pictures name.```
